<h2>TTC Alerts is a twitter bot designed to retweet all sevice anouncements related to line one</h2>

This python script uses the <strong>Tweepy</strong> library which takes advantage of streaming.
Streaming is basically monitoring a single account or select words. When something triggers the filter, you assign an action to it.



Feel free to use this script as a template for other twitter bots.
